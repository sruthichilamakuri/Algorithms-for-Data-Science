MapReduceArray contains MapReduce algorithms to take in a large file of integers and produce as output:
(a) The largest integer 
(b) The average of all the integers 
(c) The same set of integers, but with each integer appearing only once 
(d) The count of the number of distinct integers in the input 
Data: 'testdata.npy' that contains artificially generated integers

MapReduceGraph contains MapReduce algorithms to compute:
(a) Number of nodes in the graph 
(b) Average (and median) indegree and out degree 
(c) Average (and median) number of nodes reachable in two hops 
(d) Number of nodes with indegree > 100 
Data: 'Email-EuAll.txt' that forms a graph G of e-mails between users, with each line being of the form sender receiver.
